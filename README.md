## idm-serial-key

I want to clarify that I am not the original author of this script. When I initially published this script on GitHub, the primary author had not yet created an official GitHub repository. As a result, the only available option for users was to visit the official forum to download and utilize the script, later they created the Github repository. My main aim in creating this repository was to streamline the process for users. Furthermore, I ensured to credit the original creators of the script as a sign of respect for their work.
